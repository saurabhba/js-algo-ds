# FizzBuzz

Write a function that returns the string representation of all numbers from 1 to n based on the following rules:

- If it's a multiple of 3, represent it as "fizz".

- If it's a multiple of 5, represent it as "buzz".

- If it's a multiple of both 3 and 5, represent it as "fizzbuzz".

- If it's neither, just return the number itself.

As such, calling fizzBuzz(15) would result in

> '12fizz4buzzfizz78fizzbuzz11fizz1314fizzbuzz'.
